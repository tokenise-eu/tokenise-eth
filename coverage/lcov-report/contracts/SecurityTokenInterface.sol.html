 *
 *  This implementation is based on the ERC-884 standard.

 *  Implementation Details.
 *
 *  An implementation of this token standard SHOULD provide the following:
 *
 *  `name` - for use by wallets and exchanges.
 *  `symbol` - for use by wallets and exchanges.
 *
 *  The implementation MUST take care not to allow unauthorised access to share
 *  transfer functions.
 *
 *  In addition to the above the following optional `ERC20` function MUST be defined.
 *
 *  `decimals` — MUST return `0` as each token represents a single Share and Shares are non-divisible.
