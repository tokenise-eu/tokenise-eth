# Tokenise.eu Ethereum Smart Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for our Ethereum-based protocol, allowing for the tokenization of financial instruments which are compliant with regulatory standards.

The protocol is still very much under construction. This and other related repositories will be much more expanded and fully documented as development progresses.
